"Didn't expected this cabin would be so beautiful, extremely calm, quite and so neatly arranged, Not too far nor too close from the town. Apt location. We even saw fox and couple of deer while sitting in the front yard. Didn't even get to know that the cabin was old until I read in the diary kept in the cabin dated 2017, otherwise we were thinking the Cabin was very recent and new. The cabin has everything needed and overall it was very romantic and very cozy place to stay. Perfect for couples who wanna get away from city life and spend some time together in woods. I highly recommend this place.

Our Mockingbird cabin had the quietest location compared to the other cabins on the property...it was farthest back from the road.

"Absolutely perfect cabin! We arrived a little early and, after a quick phone call to make sure it was ok, was told the cabin was ready and we could go ahead and begin our stay. It was very much appreciated!! It was HOT - 102 - and I was worried the a/c wouldn’t be able to keep up but it sure did with no problems! We didn’t watch TV but I did stream Netflix and the internet was superb. Just like home! The king sized bed was nice and comfy. The back patio and front porch were both nice to sit and enjoy my coffee in the mornings and listen to the birds. The evenings were also nice outside. Super close to Downtown Wimberley and so many other fun places in the hill country. I will definitely stay here again.

"Really great place to spend a few days, get away from the stress of life. This cabin was perfect, it was comfortable and clean. We had 3 wonderful nights to rest and relax and enjoy the hill country over our Christmas mini vacation. I would highly recommend this property. There were 6 cabins but each one was very privately situated under beautiful trees. It was only a short drive into Wimberley but it seemed like we were out in the country. It was hard to pack up and leave, we enjoyed it so much.

"Loved this cozy little place that felt somewhst remote, but was actually very convenient to town and other larger cities. The mornings and evenings were peaceful and quiet, away from the hustle and bustle. I enjoyed watching a momma deer and two babies run and play early one morning. The cabin was so cute and comfortable. We enjoyed our stay very much!
